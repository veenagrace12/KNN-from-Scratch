# KNN-from-Scratch


Task - Predict the diamond price.💎

Write the KNN code from scratch and make it work on the given dataset ?

Step - 1: Load the data

Step - 2: Perform the EDA on the given dataset

Step - 3: Handle Categorical Columns i.e. convert them to numerical representation (TODO - Wisely choose between LabelEncoding and OneHotEncoding)

Step - 4: Normalize the data

Step - 5: Split the data - Test and Train (recommended 75:25 split)

Step - 6: Build KNN Algorithm from scratch and do the predictions for test data. You should not use the sklearn KNN algorithm here. Write the complete code implementation on KNN.

Step - 7: Evaluate your model

Step - 8: Train a model using sklearn KNN Algorithm and compare the results with your scratch implementation
